👋 Hi, I’m @HuiGong-dev — a Platform Engineer with a solid foundation in backend development and a growing focus on infrastructure.

🔧 I work on building and maintaining developer platforms using Kubernetes (k8s), Docker, and CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps), with an eye on scalability, reliability, and automation.

⚙️ Passionate about DevOps, cloud-native technologies, and creating smooth developer experiences.

🌱 Currently deepening my knowledge in Kubernetes, Golang, and infrastructure-as-code — while also staying mindful of system security and long-term maintainability.
